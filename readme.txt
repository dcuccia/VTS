Virtual Tissue Simulator (VTS) Project
Copyright (c) 2009 - 2019 Laser Microbeam and Medical Program

The main solution Vts.sln contains a .NET Standard 2.0 project so you will need Visual Studio 2017 and all the latest updates and service packs. If .NET Standard 2.0 is still not recognized install the .NET Core 2.0 SDK

In Visual Studio 2010, 2013 or 2015, open the file <VTS dir>/src/Vts-VS2010-2015-Compatible.sln
